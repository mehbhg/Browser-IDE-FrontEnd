# CoPanda

CoPanda is a platform built from scratch with the aim of organizing contests and providing a space to practice DSA (because that's what the world needs!!).

Yes, this project also comprises both frontend and backend (I’d say, two backends).

Three friends, one AI, and countless unproductive hours made this project possible!!

Tech Stack:
Frontend: React (Vite), TailwindCSS, ShadCN
Backend: Node.js, Docker, MongoDB, and one hypervised, lightweight, immortal virtual machine.

Let me introduce the humans (redacted for privacy):

Mehul: Of course, first me!
Ayush: The AI-envious guy
Divyanshi: The dictator

## Features

1. **Docker Images:** Used for compilation and output purposes, ensuring isolation and reducing spam.

2. **Login with GitHub OAuth:** Users don’t have to remember passwords—just log in using GitHub.

3. **Rate Limiter:** Implemented at the backend to prevent exploitation.

4. **Queue System:** Ensures our VM doesn’t get overwhelmed by managing the load efficiently.
